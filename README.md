## Features

- Filters out routine activities like meals and sleep times
- Sorts events chronologically
- Formats a clean, easy-to-read daily plan
- Delivers the plan via Telegram messaging
- Runs automatically daily via GitHub Actions
- Configurable timezone support
- Robust error handling and logging
- Environment variable validation

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- Telegram Bot API token (create one via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Calendar URLs in iCal format (.ics)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/today-plan-bot.git
   cd today-plan-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PERSONAL_ICS_URL=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/your_personal_calendar_url/basic.ics
   FAMILY_ICS_URL=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/your_family_calendar_url/basic.ics
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
   TIMEZONE=America/New_York  # Optional, defaults to America/New_York
   ```

4. Get your Telegram Chat ID:
   - Start a chat with your bot
   - Send a message to your bot
   - Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Look for the `"chat":{"id":123456789}` value in the response

## Usage

To run the bot manually:

```
npm start
```

### Setting Up Automated Daily Updates

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the bot daily. The workflow is configured to run at 9:17 AM Eastern Time (13:17 UTC).

To set up:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `PERSONAL_ICS_URL`: Your personal calendar iCal URL
   - `FAMILY_ICS_URL`: Your family calendar iCal URL
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your Telegram chat ID

The workflow will automatically run daily and can also be triggered manually from the "Actions" tab in your repository.

#### Option 2: Local Cron Job

> **Important Limitation**: The local cron job approach requires your computer to be powered on and logged in at the scheduled time. This makes it less reliable for daily automation unless you have a dedicated machine that's always running.

Create a file named `run-today-plan.sh` in your project directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/today-plan-bot
/usr/bin/node index.js >> /path/to/today-plan-bot/logs/bot.log 2>&1
```

Make it executable:

```
chmod +x run-today-plan.sh
```

Edit your crontab:

```
crontab -e
```

Add a line to run the bot at your desired time (e.g., 7:00 AM daily):

```
0 7 * * * /path/to/today-plan-bot/run-today-plan.sh
```

For a friendly morning reminder at 7 AM and an evening reminder at 6 PM:

```
0 7,18 * * * /path/to/today-plan-bot/run-today-plan.sh
```

## Customization

You can customize the excluded events by modifying the `EXCLUDED_EVENTS` array in `index.js`. These events won't appear in your daily plan.

```javascript
const EXCLUDED_EVENTS = [
  "wake up",
  "yoga",
  "Breakfast",
  "Lunch",
  "Dinner",
  // Add your own routine events here
];
```

## Telegram Message Format

The bot formats your daily plan with emojis and clear timing:

```
ðŸ“† *Today's Plan* (Tuesday, Jun 4)

ðŸ•’ 9:00 AM â€“ Team Meeting
ðŸ•’ 12:30 PM â€“ Lunch with Client
ðŸ•’ 3:00 PM â€“ Project Review
```

Events with descriptions will show the first 100 characters of the description.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not sending messages**: Verify your TELEGRAM_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
- **Missing events**: Check your calendar URLs and ensure they're accessible
- **Timezone issues**: Verify your TIMEZONE setting matches your calendar's timezone
- **Cron job not running**: Check your logs at `/path/to/today-plan-bot/logs/bot.log`
- **Environment variables**: The bot will exit with an error if any required environment variables are missing
